# Squid Archive Registry

A community-owned registry of Squid archives in a json format. 

## Usage of `@subsquid/archive-registry`

The registry is available as an npm package `@subsquid/archive-registry`. It can be used to conveniently access registry files and e.g. lookup a Squid Archive or EVM Squid Archive by network name.

### Listing the available networks

Use the included `squid-archive-registry` executable to list supported networks:

```bash
$ squid-archive-registry --help
Usage: run [options]

Display list of available archives

Options:
  -t --type <type>  Network type (choices: "evm", "substrate")
  -h, --help        display help for command
```

### Substrate archives

The first argument is the name of the network. The second argument is set of lookup filters of type `LookupOptionsSubstrate`.

```typescript
import { lookupArchive } from '@subsquid/archive-registry'

const processor = new SubstrateProcessor()
  .setDataSource({
    archive: lookupArchive("kusama"), 
  });
```

More accurate way to choose from Substrate networks is to specify `type` parameter inside options for the function. By default `type` is set to `Substrate`.

```typescript
const processor = new SubstrateProcessor()
  .setDataSource({
    archive: lookupArchive("kusama", { type: "Substrate" }), 
  });
```

`LookupOptionsSubstrate` supports additional filtering by genesis hash, archive version (semver range) and docker image names (of archive and archive gateway). 

There is also a convenience method to get network information by its name:
```typescript
  // ...
  .setDataSource({
    archive: lookupArchive("kusama", { genesis: "0xb0a8d493285c2df73290dfb7e61f870f17b41801197a149ca93654499ea3dafe" }), 
  });
```

### EVM archives

Similar to Substrate archive: first argument is the name of the network, second one is a set of lookup filters of type `LookupOptionsEVM`.

```typescript
import { lookupArchive } from '@subsquid/archive-registry'

const processor = new EvmBatchProcessor()
  .setDataSource({
    archive: lookupArchive("avalanche"), 
  });
```

`LookupOptionsEVM` supports additional filtering by release type and docker image names (of archive `ingester` and archive `worker`):

There is also a convenience method to get network information by its name:
```typescript
  // ...
  .setDataSource({
    archive: lookupArchive("avalanche", { type: "EVM", release: "Stage 1" }), 
  });
```

## What is a Squid Archive?

Squid Archive provides easy access to the historical on-chain data with little modifications. It is essential for [Substrate Squid pipelines](https://github.com/subsquid/squid-substrate-template) or [EVM Squid pipelines](https://github.com/subsquid/squid-evm-template). It can also be used on its own as a [GraphQL-based](https://graphql.org/) block explorer with powerful filtering and search capabilities over historical events and transactions.

## How to use an Archive?

The primary use case of a Squid Archive is to serve data to a [Substrate Squid Processor](https://github.com/subsquid/squid-sdk/tree/master/substrate/substrate-processor) or [EVM Squid Processor](https://github.com/subsquid/evm-processor).

The urls are not supposed to be accessed with a browser. To explore the endpoint with an interactive and human-friendly console, use `explorerUrl` field in `archives.json` (only for substrate archives). 

For example, for exploring Kusama historical data, one can inspect `archives.json` and local Kusama explorer at  `https://kusama.explorer.subsquid.io/graphql`. One can open the GraphQL playground by navigating to this url and use the pane on right hand side to filter (`where:`) and pick the fields of interest.

For example, the following query will return details on the last 10 transfers:

```gql
query RecentBalancesTransfers {
  events(orderBy: block_height_DESC, where: {name_eq: "Balances.Transfer"}, limit: 10) {
    args
    name
    call {
      name
      args
    }
    block {
      timestamp
      height
    }
  }
}

```

## How to contribute

To contribute a new archive, make a PR updating `archives.json` or `archives-evm.json` specifying the network name and the url. Further, one has to regenerate types in `src/chains.ts` by running `npm run gen-types`. This will update the list of supported chain names and makes it easier to developers to discover which lookups will succeed at compile time.
